â˜… Maverick - a small Javascript-based MVC framework 
===================================================

Maverick is right for you if...

* You want a framework with a small footprint.
* You need exceptional performance.
* You need broad compatibility with all different Javascript libraries (jQuery, Prototype, YUI, you name it).
* You want a framework that requires nearly zero configuration.
* You want a framework that applies strict variable scoping and access policies.
* You want a framework that does not require you to adhere to restrictive coding rules.

The Maverick produces 5 globally scoped variables:

* models
* views
* controllers
* routes
* uri

These variables are used to start and stop views and controllers, access the state of the application (mostly derived from the URI), and to create and remove routes.
