â˜… Maverick - a small Javascript-based MVC framework 
===================================================

Maverick is right for you if...
-------------------------------

* You want a framework with a small footprint.
* You need exceptional performance.
* You want a framework that requires nearly zero configuration.
* You want a framework that applies strict variable scoping and access policies.
* You want a framework that does not require you to adhere to restrictive coding rules.

5 globally scoped variables
--------------------------------------------------

* models
* views
* controllers
* routes
* uri

These variables are used to start and stop views and controllers, access the state of the application (mostly derived from the URI), and to create and remove routes.
