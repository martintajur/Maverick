â˜… Maverick - a small Javascript-based MVC framework 
===================================================

Maverick lets you
-----------------

* separate application logic (controller) from views and data gathering (models)
* create views and instantiate them with different context
* route URIs to controllers using regular expressions
* use centralized event handling
* change URI on browser address bar without refreshing the page (fallback to hash updating)
* execute multiple model calls at a time and provide a single callback function
* organize file structure the way you want (so that later you can combine all views, models and controllers into a single .js file in production for better page speed)
* and much more.

Maverick is right for you if...
-------------------------------

* You want a framework with a small footprint.
* You need exceptional performance.
* You want a framework that requires nearly zero configuration.
* You want a framework that applies strict variable scoping and access policies.
* You want a framework that does not require you to adhere to restrictive coding rules.

5 globally scoped variables
--------------------------------------------------

* models
* views
* controllers
* routes
* uri

These variables are used to start and stop views and controllers, access the state of the application (mostly derived from the URI), and to create and remove routes.
