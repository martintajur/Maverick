Maverick - a Javascript-based MVC framework 
===========================================

Maverick is right for you if...
You want a framework with a small footprint.
You need exceptional performance.
You need broad compatibility with standard hosting accounts that run a variety of Javascript libraries (such as jQuery, Prototype, YUI).
You want a framework that requires nearly zero configuration.
You want a framework that does not require you to use the command line.
You want a framework that does not require you to adhere to restrictive coding rules.
